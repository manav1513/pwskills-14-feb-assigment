    "\n",
    "# Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Increased performance - Multithreading can improve the performance of a program by allowing it to perform multiple tasks concurrently. By executing multiple threads in parallel, a program can take full advantage of the available CPU resources and reduce the overall execution time.\n",

    "# Disadvantages:\n",

    "# Complexity - Multithreaded programs are often more complex than single-threaded programs, and they require careful design and testing to ensure they work correctly. Synchronization and coordination between threads can be challenging to implement and debug.\n",
